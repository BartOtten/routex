## Upcoming Release

### Overview of Improvements

#### Simplified Integration
Routex now streamlines integration with your Phoenix application by extending
its functionality from compile time to runtime. This means that while route
configurations are established during compilation, Routex now supports dynamic
adjustments at runtime and influencing into runtime state.

**LiveView Hooks**

  `Routex.Extension.LiveViewHooks` detects custom hooks provided by other
  extensions and integrates them automatically into Phoenix LiveView’s
  lifecycle. This reduces manual setup and minimizes boilerplate code.

**Plugs**

  `Routex.Extension.Plugs` detects custom plugs provided by other extensions
  simplifying how extension-specific plugs are incorporated into the router’s
  plug pipeline—just a single `:routex` plug in your router module is enough to
  wire everything together. This approach cuts down on the need for extra
  configuration in your router.


```diff
# In your Routex backend module
extensions: [
  Routex.Extension.AttrGetters,
+  Routex.Extension.PhoenixLiveviewHooks,
+  Routex.Extension.Plugs,
]

# In your router.ex
pipeline :browser do
  plug :accepts, ["html"]
  plug :fetch_session
+  plug :routex
end
```

**Tech preview: SimpleLocale**

The experimental `Routex.Extension.SimpleLocale` is included as _tech preview_.
It provides Liveview lifecycle hooks and a Plug to set the runtime language or
runtime locale of all packages using `put_locale/{1,2}. For example: Gettext,
Fluent and Cldr.

Additionaly it provides a simple registry module providing the `language/1` and
`region/1` functions. These functions can be used to translate locale, region
and language identifiers to display names.

```
iex> Routex.Extension.SimpleLocale.Registry.language("nl-BE")
%{descriptions: ["Belgium"], type: :region}

iex> Routex.Extension.SimpleLocale.Registry.region("nl-BE")
%{descriptions: ["Belgium"], type: :region}


iex> Routex.Extension.SimpleLocale.Registry.language("nl")
%{descriptions: ["Dutch", "Flemish"], type: :language}

iex> Routex.Extension.SimpleLocale.Registry.region("BE")
%{descriptions: ["Belgium"], type: :region}
```

See it's documentation for the available configuration options. Feedback is
highly welcome.


#### Improved Developer Experience

**Clearer Error Messages**

Configuration issues now trigger clearer error messages. Instead of encountering
a full stacktrace, you receive concise guidance to help pinpoint and resolve
common mistakes.

```
Routex Error: Missing required implementation of `attrs/1`.

       None of the enabled extensions provide an implementation for `attrs/1`.
       Please ensure that you have added and configured an extension that
       implements this function. For more details on how to set up the
       AttrGetters extension, see the documentation:

       https://hexdocs.pm/routex/Routex.Extension.AttrGetters.html
```

```
Extension 'Routex.Extension.404' is missing
```


**Faster Compilation**

Optimizations have been made to improve compile times, even when managing
configurations with a large number of routes. A brief summary of the processed
routes is now provided during compilation.

```elixir
Routex.Processing >> Routes >> Original: 16 | Generated: 100 | Total: 116
```

#### Enhanced Reliability and Debugging

**Increased Test Coverage**

With over 90% test coverage, the core functionality and error-handling paths
have been thoroughly verified. This improvement helps reduce regressions and
ensures better stability.

#### Extension Development


**AST Inspection Option**

A new configuration setting allows developers to output the generated Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST) for inspection. This additional transparency can be valuable
for diagnosing issues during macro-based code generation.

```elixir
# In config/dev.ex
config :routex, helper_mod_dir: "/tmp"
```

During compilation, the generated code is saved to your specified directory for review:

```bash
Wrote AST of Elixir.ExampleWeb.Router.RoutexHelpers to /tmp/ExampleWeb.Router.RoutexHelpers.ex
```

Ready to be inspected.
`cat /tmp/ExampleWeb.Router.RoutexHelpers.ex`

```elixir
defmodule ExampleWeb.Router.RoutexHelpers do
  @moduledoc "This code is generated by Routex and is for inspection purpose only\n"

    require Logger
    use Routex.HelperFallbacks

    @doc "Returns Routex attributes of given URL\n"
    def attrs(url) when is_binary(url) do
        url |> Matchable.new() |> attrs()
    end
end
```


**Provide LiveView Lifecycle Hooks**

`Routex.Extension.LiveViewHooks` detects LiveView Lifecycle callbacks and
inlines their bodies. Each callback receives the standard LiveView parameters
plus `attrs` containing the current route's Routex attributes.

**Available Callbacks**

- `handle_params/4`
- `handle_event/4`
- `handle_info/4`
- `handle_async/4`
- `after_render/4`

**Example**

```elixir
# In a Routex extension
defmodule MyExtension do
  @behaviour Routex.Extension

  # Hook receives the same parameters as LiveView plus attrs
  def handle_params(params, url, socket, attrs) do
    # Modify socket based on Routex attributes
    {:cont, assign(socket, my_key: attrs.my_value)}
  end

  def handle_event(event, params, socket, attrs) do
    # Custom event handling with route context
    {:cont, socket}
  end
end
```


**Provide a Plug**

`Routex.Extension.Plugs` detects `plug/3` callbacks and
inlines their bodies. The callback receives the standard `Plug.call` parameters
plus `attrs` containing the current route's Routex attributes.

**Example**

```elixir
defmodule MyExtension do
  @behaviour Routex.Extension

  def plug(conn, _opts, attrs) do
    # Access route-specific attributes
    if attrs.require_auth do
      MyAuth.ensure_authenticated(conn)
    else
      conn
    end
  end
end
```
