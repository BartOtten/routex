Routex: Phoenix route localization and beyond....\n\nRoutex is a comprehensive, batteries included framework built on top of Phoenix,\ndesigned to streamline and empower your routing workflows. By simplifying route\nmanipulation at compile time and enabling the use of custom route attributes\nduring runtime, Routex provides the granular control needed to tackle the most\ncomplex routing challenges.\n\nIts modern, extensible architecture allows for effortless creation of custom\nsolutions, extending its functionality far beyond standard routing.","ref":"readme.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Localize Phoenix - Overview","doc":"For developers seeking robust Phoenix localization solutions, Routex excels. It\noffers a suite of extensions enabling internationalization (i18n) and\nlocalization (l10n), including but not limited to seamless support for\ntranslated (multilingual) URLs, locale preference detection at run time and\nsupport for multiple backends.\n\nThe included extension `Localize Phoenix` simplifies Phoenix localization by\ndetecting already used localization packages (Cldr, Gettext or Fluent) and\nautomatically generate routes based on their existing configuration for a\nseamless experience or using your manual configuration for powerful\ncustomization.\n\nThe extension includes an `IANA` based locale registry\nfor robust locale validation and conversion to display names.\n\nForget any notion of difficult setup – localizing your Phoenix application with\nRoutex is a breeze. Just copy the example configuration from our [Localize\nPhoenix using Routex guide](docs/guides/LOCALIZE_PHOENIX.md) for an effortless\nstart.\n\n \nThis documentation reflects the main branch.

This enables extensions to provide powerful runtime\n  features such as automatically locale detection and synchronization between\n  the server, client, and LiveView processes- without requiring modifications\n  throughout your codebase.\n\n* **Drop-in solution:** Extensions are highly configurable, allowing you to use\n  Routex features as drop-in solution. For example: Routex can be configured to\n  remain compatible with Phoenix' template generators. As such, it doesn't\n  disrupt standard Phoenix development practices lowering the learning curve. It\n  can also be configured to mimic Cldr-Routes with its tight integration wirth\n  Cldr and use of custom sigils.\n\n* **Optimized Performance:** Positioned between route configuration and\n  compilation, Routex core enhances Phoenix routes without incurring additional\n  runtime costs. Extensions too are optimized for runtime performance, making\n  use of Elixirs superb pattern matching.\n\n* **No dependencies, no state**: Routex is unique in not depending on other\n  libraries and works out-of-the-box without process state. An extension to\n  control third-party libraries that do rely on state such as Gettext is\n  included.\n\n* **Detailed documentation**: Comprehensive, well-organized documentation\n  provides clear guidance on installation, configuration, and best practices,\n  making Routex approachable for developers at all levels.","ref":"readme.html#benefits-and-features"},{"type":"extras","title":"Give it a try! - Overview","doc":"**[Online demo](https://routex.fly.dev/)** - have a look or get the\n[code](https://github.com/BartOtten/routex_example/).","ref":"readme.html#give-it-a-try"},{"type":"extras","title":"Installation and usage - Overview","doc":"**[Usage Guide](USAGE.md)** - requirements and installation.\ninstructions.\n\n**[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/routex)** - from step-by-step guides till in-depth explanations.","ref":"readme.html#installation-and-usage"},{"type":"extras","title":"Knowledge Base - Overview","doc":"To better understand how Routex integrates with Phoenix Router and where it fits\ninto the broader ecosystem, take a look at our in-depth guides:\n\n**[How Routex and Phoenix Router Work Together](docs/ROUTEX_AND_PHOENIX_ROUTER.md)** - \nDiscover the mechanics behind the integration and the benefits of a unified routing system.\n\n**[Routex compared to Phoenix Router and Cldr Routes](docs/COMPARISON.md)** - \nUnderstand the differences, strengths, and tradeoffs when deciding which\nrouting solution best fits your needs.","ref":"readme.html#knowledge-base"},{"type":"extras","title":"Extensions - Overview","doc":"Routex comes equipped with a extensions that cater to common and advanced use\ncases in Phoenix applications.

Zero-Config Localization with Multilingual Routing - Release Notes","doc":"Building multilingual Phoenix sites used to mean scattering locale detection,\nLiveView hooks, and dynamic-route logic throughout your code. **Routex 1.2.0**\nreplaces all that with a single, centralized configuration. Your router stays\nclean, localization is applied at compile time, and runtime dispatching\nseamlessly handles any additional needs—no extra wiring required.\n\nThe new Localization system is a game-changer automatically detecting your\nexisting Phoenix localization setup and making everything work out of the box.\nLet's see this magic in action with a typical Phoenix application:\n\n```elixir\n# lib/my_app_web/routex_backend.ex\ndefmodule ExampleWeb.RoutexBackend do\n    use Routex.Backend,\n      extensions: [\n        Routex.Extension.Attrs,\n        Routex.Extension.LiveViewHooks,\n        Routex.Extension.Plugs,\n        Routex.Extension.Localize.Phoenix.Routes,\n        Routex.Extension.Localize.Phoenix.Runtime,\n        Routex.Extension.RuntimeDispatcher\n      ]\n```\n\nUsing the sane defaults of the extensions Routex will transforms your routes\nbased on your Gettext locales (or Cldr, or Fluent). For example, if your Gettext has \"en\" (default),\n\"fr\", and \"nl\" configured, Routex automatically generates:\n\n```elixir\n# Example: Generated Routes\n# Original route: /products\n\"/products\"          # Default locale (en)\n\"/fr/products\"       # French\n\"/nl/products\"       # Dutch\n```\n\nThe magic continues at runtime. Routex automatically:\n1. Detects the user's preferred language from a variary of sources\n2. Sets up Gettext with the correct locale\n3. Maintains the locale across LiveView navigation\n4. Provides helper functions for switching locales\n\nWant to customize? No problem! The zero-config setup can be enhanced with\nexplicit configuration. Here are a few examples:\n\n```elixir\n# lib/my_app_web/routex_backend.ex\n\n# Override auto-detected locale settings for route generation\nlocales: [\"en-US\", \"fr-FR\", \"nl-BE\": %{language_display_name: \"DUTCH\"}}],\ndefault_locale: \"en-US\",\n\n# Customize URL generation: results in /english, /french, /dutch\nlocale_prefix_sources: [:language_display_name],\n\n# Customize URL generation: results in \"/\", \"/world\", \"/france\", \"/netherlands\", \"/belgium\"\nlocale_prefix_sources: :region_display_name\n\n# Customize region detection order: fixed to route attribute, no overrides\nregion_sources: [:route],\n\n# Customize language detection order\nlanguage_sources: [:query, :session, :accept_language, :route]\n```\n\nThe Localize extensions come with a IANA Language Subtags based locale registry\ncovering common needs. The `language/1` and `region/1` functions can be used to\ntranslate locale, region and language identifiers to display names. `language?`\nand `region?` validate input.\n\n```elixir\n# single subtag\niex> Routex.Extension.Localize.Registry.region(\"BE\")\n%{descriptions: [\"Belgium\"], type: :region}\n\n# double subtag\niex> Routex.Extension.Localize.Registry.language(\"nl-BE\")\n%{descriptions: [\"Dutch\", \"Flemish\"], type: :language}\n```","ref":"release_notes.html#1-zero-config-localization-with-multilingual-routing"},{"type":"extras","title":"2.

Assuming their language based on their IP address\n  (which indicates location) would be inaccurate.\n\n* **Expatriates and Travelers:** Someone living abroad might prefer to browse in\n  their native language, even if they're physically located in a different\n  country. A German expat in Spain might still want to see the website in\n  German.\n\n* **Language Learning:** Some users might prefer to browse in a language they're\n  learning, regardless of their location.\n\n* **Shared Computers:** In internet cafes, libraries, or shared family\n  computers, users might not have control over the browser's language settings.\n  Relying on these settings can lead to an incorrect language selection.\n\n**The Problem with `Accept-Language` HTTP Header:**\n\nWebsites often use the `Accept-Language` HTTP header, sent by the browser, to\ndetermine the user's preferred language. While this can be helpful, it's not\nfoolproof. As mentioned above, on shared computers, the `Accept-Language` header\nmight reflect the preferences of a previous user. Users might also not know how\nto change this setting, or it might be locked by system administrators in\ncertain environments. Therefore, relying solely on this header can lead to a\nfrustrating experience.\n\n**Examples of What *Not* to Do:**\n\n* **Automatic Redirection Based on IP:** A user in Canada is automatically\n  redirected to the French version of the site, even though their browser and\n  system language are set to English. This is a classic example of location\n  overriding language preference.\n\n* **Flag Icons as Language Options:** Using flag icons to represent language is\n  problematic. Flags represent countries, not languages. What about Spanish\n  speakers in the US? Or English speakers in India? This conflates nationality\n  with language.\n\n* **Hidden Language Settings:** Language options are buried deep in the footer\n  or only appear after navigating through several pages. Users shouldn't have to\n  hunt for their preferred language.\n\n* **Sole Reliance on `Accept-Language`:** The website assumes the browser's\n  language setting is the user's actual preference, ignoring the possibility of\n  shared computers or incorrect settings.","ref":"localization_vs_translation.html#the-problem-conflating-location-and-language"},{"type":"extras","title":"The Solution: Always Give Users Control - Localization vs Translation","doc":"The key is to treat location and language as distinct, yet related, pieces of\ninformation *and always give users explicit control over both*. Here's how to do\nit right:\n\n* **Explicit Language Selection:** Provide clear and prominent language options,\n  ideally using the language name itself (e.g., \"English,\" \"Español,\" \"Deutsch\")\n  rather than flags. Place these options in a visible location, such as the\n  header or footer, *on every page*.\n\n* **Location as a Secondary Consideration:** Use location data (IP address) to\n  *suggest* a default language and/or currency, but *always* allow the user to\n  override this suggestion. A simple popup or banner saying \"We've detected\n  you're in [Location]. Would you like to view the site in [Suggested Language]?\n  [Yes/No]\" is a good approach. Even if they click \"yes,\" the language option\n  should *still* be readily available.\n\n* **User Profiles and Preferences:** For returning users, store their language\n  and location preferences in their user profile. This ensures a consistent\n  experience across sessions.\n\n* **Content Localization, Not Just Translation:** Consider cultural nuances and\n  adapt content accordingly. Simply translating text without considering\n  cultural context can be ineffective or even offensive. Dates, times, and units\n  of measurement should also be localized.\n\n* **Clear Location Settings:** If location-specific content is crucial (e.g.,\n  store locator, shipping information), provide a separate and easy-to-use\n  location selection mechanism. This could be a dropdown menu or a map\n  interface.\n\n**Example of How to Do It Right:**\n\n* A user lands on a website and sees a small popup: \"We've detected you're in\n  the UK. Would you like to view prices in GBP and the site in English?\n  [Yes/No]\"\n\n* *Regardless* of the user's choice in the popup, a language dropdown menu is\n  *always* visible in the header, offering options like \"English,\" \"Français,\"\n  \"Español,\" etc.\n\n* The footer contains a link to \"Change Location,\" where the user can specify\n  their country for location-specific content.\n\nBy implementing these best practices, websites can create a more inclusive and\nuser-friendly experience for their global audience. Respecting the distinction\nbetween location and language, and *always giving users the control to choose*,\nis not just good practice, it's essential for building trust and maximizing your\nonline reach.","ref":"localization_vs_translation.html#the-solution-always-give-users-control"},{"type":"extras","title":"How Routex' approach helps - Localization vs Translation","doc":"Routex's approach to localized routing reinforces the principle of keeping\nlanguage and location distinct. No implicit information is embedded in the\nroutes.\n\nWhen dealing with **region-based pages** changing a user's region (and thus the\nassociated region-specific content) doesn't necessitate an automatic language\nswitch. And when dealing with **language-based pages** changing a user's\nlanguage doesn't necessitate an automatic region switch.\n\nImagine a scenario where a user is browsing a **region-based** site in English\nbut wants to see the pricing and product availability for the Indian market.\nWith Routex, they can navigate to the India region-specific page (e.g.,\n/in/products) without being forced to switch to another language. The site can\nmaintain the user's preferred language (English in this case) while displaying\nthe relevant Indian content.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to systems where language and region are implicitly\nlinked. In such cases, switching regions might inadvertently trigger a language\nchange, leading to a confusing and frustrating user experience.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nLocalization and translation serve different purposes and should be handled\nseparately to provide the best user experience. Similarly, **a user's preferred\nlanguage should not be assumed based on their location**. By keeping these\nelements distinct, websites can ensure better usability, compliance, and\nengagement for a global audience.\n\nBy adopting **a user-first approach**, where language is a choice and location\nis used only for relevant regional settings, businesses can create a seamless,\naccessible, and culturally appropriate experience for all users.","ref":"localization_vs_translation.html#how-routex-approach-helps"},{"type":"extras","title":"Routex and Phoenix Router","doc":"# How Routex and Phoenix Router Work Together: A Blueprint for Understanding\n\n \n All code on this page is for illustration purpose only.

It is\nexpected to return a list of Phoenix.Router.Route structs.\n\n\n#### Flattening option values\n\nExtensions can make use of `Routex.Attrs` provided by Routex itself, Routex\nbackends and other extensions.\n\nTo make the availability of the attributes as predictable as possible, Routex\nuses a flat structure which is stored in a routes' `private.routex` field.\nHowever, using a flat structure might conflict with developer experience;\nsometimes a nested structure to provide configuration options might be more\nsuitable.\n\nOne responsibility of the `transform/3` callback is to flatten the structure of\nattributes they use for each route they receive, so other extensions can use\nattributes set by the current extension without knowledge of the configuration\nstructure.\n\n**Example**\nThe Alternatives extension uses nested options and allows inheritance\nof attributes from parent branches.\n\n```\nalternatives: %{\n  \"/\" =>\n    helper: nil,\n    locale: \"en_GB\",\n    branches: %{\n      \"nl\" => %{\n          helper: \"nl\",\n          locale: \"nl_NL\"\n        },\n      \"gb\" => %{\n        helper: \"gb\",\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThe Alternatives module is therefor responsible for flattening those for\n(itself and) other extensions to use. To take the route responsible for the\n\"gb\" branch as an example, the extension should add flattened attributes in the\nRoute struct. It can do so using the helper function `Routex.Attrs.put/2`.\n\n```\nRoutex.Attrs.put(route, [locale: \"en_GB\", helper: \"gb\"])\n```\n\nNow the `Translation` extension can search for the option `:locale` in the\nroute's attributes, unaware of how that locale was initially configured.","ref":"extension_development.html#stage-2-transform"},{"type":"extras","title":"Stage 3: Post Transform - Extensions","doc":"The `post_transform` stage can be used knowing all other attributes of a route\nare available and no path will be transformed any further.","ref":"extension_development.html#stage-3-post-transform"},{"type":"extras","title":"Stage 4: Create helper functions - Extensions","doc":"In this stage helper functions can be generated which will be added to\n`MyAppWeb.Router.RoutexHelpers`.
